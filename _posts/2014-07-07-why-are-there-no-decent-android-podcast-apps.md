What gives?  All the Android podcast apps are pretty bad.  They all seem buggy and look horrendous.  Back in the day there was Google Listen but even it had issues.  Then came some apps that used Google Reader as a back end.  They were not great but they kind of worked.  Reader left the scene and everything left standing fails to meet my needs.  I've been using Podax for a while but it is really buggy.  I'm debating writing my own simple podcast player app.  Here are some of the features I will need.

* Support for a single Tiny Tiny RSS feed.  Additional feed management is performed by Tiny Tiny RSS.
* Follow the Google style guidelines.
* Pre-fetch episodes.
* Restart playing an episode where I left off.
