I'm thinking more and more that I need a new side project to work on.  The project needs to be something that I
personally need. I don't care if no one else will find it useful.  A podcast app is most likely going to be that
project. I listen to podcasts on my daily commute and I am really getting tired of how poor the apps are.  I need
something better.  The app needs to be simple and useful while following current UX standards.  That means material
design.  It has been a while since I have written an Android application.  It will be interesting to see how things
have changed since I worked on mkRemote.
